  <h1>[Golang] not() in goquery</h1>

  <div class="info">
    When I was using goquery library, I was thinking of getting rid of some
    of the content inside the node. So I used not function to filter that
    nodes. But it didn't turn out to be what I want. <br />
    After searching, I found that not function is to filter a list instead
    of filtering all the nodes inside that node within any depth.
