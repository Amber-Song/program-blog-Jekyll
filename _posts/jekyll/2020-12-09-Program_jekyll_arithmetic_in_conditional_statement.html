  <h1>[Jekyll] arithmetic in conditional expression doesnt work</h1>

  <div class="info">
    When I write in Jekyll, I want something like every second element using one piece of code 
    and the others using other piece of code. So I wrote something like: 

    <pre>
      <code>
    &lbrace;% if loopindex % 2 == 0 %}
      // do something
    &lbrace;% else %}
      // do something
    &lbrace;% endif %}
      </code>
    </pre>
    
    But it doesn't work. After I search online, I realised that 

    <ul>
      <li>First thing first, this is not liquid syntax. Liquid uses maths filter for arithmetic instead of maths symbol.</li>

      <li>Filter can't be used in liquid if expression as pipes are not allowed in such a control structure.
        And this will finally resolve to <code>&lbrace;% if loopindex %}</code>  which is always true.
        To solve this problem, I have to assign the calculation to a variable then use it in if expression.</li>
    </ul>

    So the code should be like this.

    <pre>
      <code>
    &lbrace;% assign i = loopindex | modulo: 2 %}
    &lbrace;% if i == 0 %}
      // do something
    &lbrace;% else %}
      // do something
    &lbrace;% endif %}
      </code>
    </pre>

  </div>
