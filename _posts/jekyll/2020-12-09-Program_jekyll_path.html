  <h1>[Jekyll] path</h1>

  <div class="info">
    After months of development, I got used to using the relative path. But it doesn't work well in Jekyll. <br>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The first problem I came across was I tried to put an image in [Golang] get data out of struct blog. 
        It didn't throw any errors but the image can't be found. My code is like this, <br>
        <code>&lt;img src="../../assets/call_element_out_of_struct.png" width="300px" /></code>
      </li>

      <li>
        Then I wanted to display all the blogs in Golang folder which is a sub-folder of _posts folder. 
        I know that to show all the posts, it could be easily done by site.posts. As Golang folder is a sub-folder, 
        I thought I could do this by site.posts.Golang. Still it didn't throw any errors, but nothing showed on the page.
        My code is like this, <code>&lbrace;% for post in site.posts.golang %}</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

    After exploring, I found that Jekyll will rearrange the folder structure while building the whole website. 
    That's why the relative path I used for images or links doesn't work. The folder assets will be still in the root folder, 
    so it is better to use the absolute path for the stuff saved in assets. <br> <br>
    
    For the posts, I found how the file structure looks like from inspecting the html file. 
    The post lives in /sub-folder-name/year/month/date, shown in the image below. <br> <br>

    <img src="/assets/folder_structure_after_compil.png" alt="folder structure" style="width: 90%;"> <br> <br>

    Apparently, Jekyll could detect all the html file naming correctly (using the format specified in Jekyll documentation) 
    but it can't detect the folder itself. That's why I got the second problem. To solve the second question, I found there are two ways:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Add data in each Jekyll html file and use the where filter to get the list of the posts which meet the request. <br>
        <pre>
          <code>
  In post file:
  ---
  category: golang
  ---

  In post list:
  &lbrace;% assign golang = site.posts | where: "category", "golang" %}
  &lbrace;% for post in golang %}
          </code>
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        Jekyll can actually detect categories and group by categories. <br>
        <pre>
          <code>
  In post file:
  ---
  categories:
    - golang
  ---

  In post list:
  &lbrace;% for post in site.categories.golang %}

          </code>
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
