  <h1>[React] access DOM in reactjs</h1>

  <div class="info">
    When I just switched from vanilla js to reactjs, I felt very it very
    different when I wanted to do something which needs access to DOM.
    <br />
    Like when I want to change the class of one element to another class, I
    used to write:
    <code>
      document.getElementById('bid').className = 'show-more';
    </code>
    <br />
    But in reactjs I can't get the node by getElementById function or
    anything like that. In reactjs, it need to use another way to achieve
    this by making the class or inner HTML or anything I want to change the
    state. Instead of picking the node and change it, I make it variable
    inside state and when I want to change it, I change the value of the
    variable.<br />
    <br />
    I also saw there is another way, using the useRef hook. But I haven't
    explored that one. I will add more once I get more information about
    that.
