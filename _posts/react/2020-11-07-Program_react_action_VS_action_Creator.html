  <h1>
    [React] Action VS Action creator [Question mark]
  </h1>

  <div class="info">
    I was confused by the action and action creator. So in this article, I
    will explain how I understand it now. <br />
    <br />

    <em
      >In short, action is an object while action creator is a function.</em
    >

    <pre class="code">
      <code>
    // Action creator return an action
    const addWord = (word, meaning) => {
        const lastCheckTime = new Date().toGMTString();

        return {
            type: "ADDWORD",
            payload: {
            word,
            meaning,
            lastCheckTime,
            checkPeriod: 0
            }
        };
    };
      </code>
    </pre>

    addWord() is action creator. It is a function. And it creates action by
    returning an object. While that object is an action.

    <pre class="code">
        <code>
    return &lt;button onClick={() => dispatch(addWord(word, meaning))}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;;
        </code>
    </pre>

    When the onClick function is triggered, it dispatches the action, or to
    say the object.
    <br /><br />

    But there is one thing that I am still not that sure. When an action is
    dispatched, how could the react know which reducer is that if there are
    multiple reducers?
