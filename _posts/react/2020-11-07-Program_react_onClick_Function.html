  <h1>
    [React] function vs function() in react
  </h1>

  <div class="info">
    I came across a problem in
    <a
      href="https://github.com/Amber-Song/dictionary/blob/comment-version/frontend/src/features/dictionary/AddWordButton.js"
      >AddWordButton file</a
    >, I tried to dispatch the addWord action to add a word in the redux.
    But I found that before I clicked the button, this function has already
    been run! The code is like this:

    <pre class="code">
        <code>
    return &lt;button onClick={dispatch(addWord(word, meaning))}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;;
        </code>
    </pre>

    After I searched, I found that searching() is calling the function
    referenced by searching. Searching itself is just a reference to a
    function, it doesn't call the function.
    <br /><br />
    So in reactjs, if I take onclick as an example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        if that is a function without parameter, you should the function
        like this. <br />
        <code>
              &lt;button onClick="{searching}"&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        if that is a function with parameter, you should the function like
        this. <br />
        <code>
              &lt;button onClick={() => dispatch(addWord(word,
              meaning))}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
