    [React] Reducer return undefined during initialization
  </h1>

  <div class="info">
    When I was working on the redux reducer in
    <a
      href="https://github.com/Amber-Song/dictionary/blob/comment-version/frontend/src/features/dictionary/glossarySlice.js"
      >glossarySlice file</a
    >, I came across an error like this and my reducer file is like
    following.
    <br />
    <br />

    <div class="error-message">
      Error: Reducer "glossary" returned undefined during initialization. If
      the state passed to the reducer is undefined, you must explicitly
      return the initial state. The initial state may not be undefined. If
      you don't want to set a value for this reducer, you can use null
      instead of undefined.
    </div>

    <pre class="code">
      <code>
    const glossarySlice = (state = initState, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
        case "ADDWORD":
            return [...state, action.payload];
    
        case "UPDATEWORD": {
            const word = action.payload.word;
            let newArray = state.slice();
            const index = newArray.findIndex(item => item.word === word);
            newArray[index] = action.payload;
            return newArray;
        }
    
        case "REMOVEWORD": {
            const word = action.payload.word;
            let newArray = state.slice();
            const index = newArray.findIndex(item => item.word === word);
            newArray.splice(index, 1);
            return newArray;
        }
    };
      </code>
    </pre>

    After searching online, I found out that I have to add default case in
    the switch. Because for the first time, reducer doesn't have any value
    in which situation it can't match any of the cases. So it needs to fail
    in one case to initiate which is the default case. So the correct one
    should be:

    <pre class="code">
        <code>
    const glossarySlice = (state = initState, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
        case "ADDWORD":
            return [...state, action.payload];
    
        case "UPDATEWORD": {
            const word = action.payload.word;
            let newArray = state.slice();
            const index = newArray.findIndex(item => item.word === word);
            newArray[index] = action.payload;
            return newArray;
        }
    
        case "REMOVEWORD": {
            const word = action.payload.word;
            let newArray = state.slice();
            const index = newArray.findIndex(item => item.word === word);
            newArray.splice(index, 1);
            return newArray;
        }

        default:
            return state;
    };
        </code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>
