    [React] why using const keyword in reactjs
  </h1>

  <div class="info">
    In vanilla js,
    <ul>
      <li>
        variable with <em>const</em> keyword can not be reassigned and it is
        block-scoped
      </li>
      <li>
        variable with <em>let</em> keyword is reassigned and it is
        block-scoped
      </li>
      <li>
        variable with <em>var</em> keyword is also reassigned but it is
        function-scoped
      </li>
    </ul>
    That is why in vanilla js, we usually use the let keyword. So I was
    confused why in all the tutorial, they wrote variables with const
    keyword in useState hook even when I was pretty sure that those
    variables would change in the following commend. Then I found that when
    properties or states change, the component will be rerendered. And the
    function will be executed again which will cause it to create a new
    scope again. Then, the variable with const will be assigned a new value
    instead of reassigning values.
